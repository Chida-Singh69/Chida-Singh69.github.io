            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
              I'm Chidananda Singh A, part-time jester, full-time builder (outside my Minecraft village). I go by Chida for obvious reasons. I build, fail, adapt and learn, and probably build, fail, adapt and learn again.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              It was long. Pretty long, before my goofball head came around to tinkering with actual codebases. For those of you who care, I fiddled with my ancient PC, and ended up pirating and playing games like CS 1.6, Minecraft, or things that could run on P.C. the Late. And that's pretty much all for my generic tech bro origin story, which might turn into villain origin one, if you disprove of my candidature :3
            </p>
            
            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>
             I'll do whatever I'm asked of,  20 dollars is  20 dollars (ball knowledge)
            </p>
            
            <h3>When I'm Not Coding</h3>
            <p>
              I constantly clutter and clean my workspace, save up my salary and then blow it on clothes, partake in side quests which can range from bathing my dogs, to playing Valorant to visiting temples (a LOT of them). All that said, I'm just a chill guy with a resume.
